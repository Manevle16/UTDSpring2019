1. Naiive Bayes
   Consider a patient that has recieved test results T+ meaning the test is positive for
   cancer. Calculate P(cancer|T+). Here is what we know about the probabilites of cancer
   and not cancer, and the probabilities of T+(test positive):

   P(cancer) = 0.008
   P(T+|cancer) = 0.98
   P(T+)

   a) Write out the Baye's theorem using the notations above:
      P(cancer|T+) = (P(T+|cancer) X P(cancer))/P(T+)

   b) Write the mathematical expression to calculate P(cancer|T+) using your formula from
      a) above and the data above
      P(cancer|T+) =  (.98 X .008)/P(T+)     

   c) Why is Naiive Bayes called "naiive"?
      Because the algorithm makes assumptions about the data that may or may not be correct. Naiive Bayes will 
      assume the presence or absence of a feature will not affect the presence or absence of another feature.

2. What is step 1 of the k-means algorithm?
   
3. What is a centroid in k-means clustering and how is it determined in the iterative cycles of
   the algorithm.
4. In one run of the KNN model, k=1 and in another run k=7.
   a) If the data set is very small and sparse, which k might be better? why?
   b) if the data is very large, which k might be better? why?
   c) Given knn with k=5, describe how knn:
      i) calculate the real value in regression
      ii) selects a class in classification

  a) In k-means clustering, k centroids are:
  b) In the k-means algorithm, data points are assigned to a cluster in what fashion?
  c) If your algorithm performs well on the training data but poorly on test data, you are 
     suffering from? 
  d) In linear regression, what are residuals?
  e) * In Logistic regression model, which variables were important and which ones were not?
  f) * What was the accuracy of the logistic regression model and decision tree model?
  g) Is it a good idea to prune the tree? Why or why not?
  h) * Compare the accuracy of the logistic regression and the decision tree?
  i) * Which model (LR, or DT) might be more meaningful to a doctor, and why?
  j) * Which variables were important (2 or 3 **) in the LR model?
  k) * Which variables were used to created the DT?
  l) * What was the accuracy of the pruned tree?

6)
  a) Is KNN a parametric algorithm?
  b) can KNN be used for both classification and regression?
  c) P(A|B) = P(B|A) X P(A) / P(B)
     Need to know what each component is?
  d) Does decision tree tend to be less accurate than other supervised methods?
  e) Decision trees can be used for both classification and regression? T/F
  f) Decision trees are always more accurate after pruning? T/F
  g) What is characterized by low bias and high variance? (LR, LOGR, DT)
  h) What is characterized by high bias, low variance?
  i) Why do we prune decision trees?
  j) In which type of learning target variable is a real number? and a class variable?
  k) What is the prupose of train and test data sets?
  
7) In a given problem, we are interested in using the ID3 decision tree induction algorithm to
   automatically determine something. Show the decision tree created by the ID3 desion tree learning algorithm. Show      the information gain calculations that you computed to create the tree.

    v) Create LR model on training where AHD is predicted by all other variables
   vi) Run a summary of the model
  vii) Predict Yes/No on the test data
 viii) Compute the accuracy

    i) Create a decision tree model on the training data
   ii) Run a summary of the model
  iii) Make predictions of the test data
   iv) Compute the accuracy
    v) Print the tree with labels
   vi) Cross Validation
