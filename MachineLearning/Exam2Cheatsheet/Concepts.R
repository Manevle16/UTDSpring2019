# 1. Multiple Regression
# Having more than one predictor to predict a response
#
# 2. Ridge Regression
# Makes regression coefficients trend towards 0 by increasing the lambda value to introduce bias and decrease variance.
#
# 3. Multicollinearity
# When two or more predictors in a regression are highly correlated to one another, such that they do not provide
# unique info to the regression
#
# 4. Bias Vs Variance
# There is a bias-variance trade off where too much bias will cause the model to be inaccurate on the training data
# and too much variance will cause the model to be very accurate on the trainging data but innaccurate for the testing
# data
#
# 5. Regression Coefficients 
# The value that is being multiplied against the predictor typically signifying its importance
#
# 6. Collinearity leads to overfitting
# Collinearity (Multicollinearity) leads to predictors that have regression coefficients that are not uniquely 
# determined. This will cause the the model to have too much varience and not very interpretable since any affect on
# one of the pridectors involved in the collinearity will also affect any other predictors associated with it.
